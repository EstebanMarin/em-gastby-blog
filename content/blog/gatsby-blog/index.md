> Where you see an absolute overkill, I see amazing learning oportunities


# why?

I wanted a blog to promote myself, without actually doing it myself. While at the same time making the building process a learning experience that I could profit from in the long run.


The target that I set for the learning process:
- The building process of the blog should give solid skills for a code challenge interview. Furthermore, create an infrastructure to facilitate these types of interviews in the future.
- I wanted to learn more about AWS/JAM-stack/Gatsby, because I want to get comfortable with it. I want to build more MVPs soon
- Blog about it

# what?

I want a lighthouse-compliant, react server-side rendered, cloud-native, Integrated CI/CD to my Github account, free-hosting, pointing at my URL, that was easy to maintain. 
I feel this will allow me to build the MVPs I want to start building soon.
